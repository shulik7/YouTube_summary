# YouTube Summary with Local LLM

A fun project exploring the usability of small open-source language models (like **Llama3-8B**) for practical applications—specifically, summarizing recent YouTube videos from subscribed channels using a locally run LLM.

This tool checks for new uploads from specified YouTube channels within a given timeframe and generates summaries using transcripts processed by a local LLM via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/). The goal is to reduce time spent browsing YouTube while still staying updated on content from favorite creators.

> Built as an experiment in leveraging lightweight, open-source models for real-world tasks—without relying on closed APIs like OpenAI's GPT.

## Features

- 📺 Fetches latest videos from YouTube channels
- ⏳ Filters videos based on recency (e.g., last week)
- 🗣️ Summarizes video content using local LLMs via Ollama and LangChain
- 💬 Supports English and Chinese transcripts with translation to English for better summarization

## Why?

I spend too much time watching YouTube—even from favorite channels. Instead of passively consuming every upload, I wanted a lightweight way to **get the gist first**, then decide whether to watch.

This repo explores:
- Using small open-source LLMs (like `llama3:8b`) for summarization and text processing
- Creative use of LLM reasoning instead of traditional parsing (e.g., comparing "5 days ago" vs "1 week")
- How far we can go with local models before needing larger, closed ones

## Usage

```bash
python app.py channel_list.txt "2 weeks" output.json
```
